# api-requirements



## Requirements
PHP 8.1 is required to run this application and you must have composer cli command available on your terminal.

## Installation
Please clone this repository to your development environment
run ```composer install``` to install Laravel application dependencies
run ```php artisan serve``` command to get the application to serve instantly
open your browser or use whichever API client (Postman/Insominia) and try make a normal GET request to http://localhost:8000/api/products

## Implementation details
I have registered singleton instance of DiscountManager which is accessed through the facade class DiscountEngine to register all the
discount rules as expected according to your instructions. You can see that inside the routes/api.php file.
Once the discount engine rules are set, the inventory repository class is instantiated and it returns the products which under goes 
through collection of DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) that goes through pipeline to apply price filter and apply discounts. The final result
is returned as expected.

#Note
Here is a security concern that I wish to flag up for this project. I felt I should inform you that if every job applicant is suppose to fork
your repository, it will kind of expose all those who have applied and their forks. I am worried, this can allow others to see the work 
that was done. All forks are visible from this link:
https://github.com/takumi-software/api-requirements/network/members





BELOW IS COPY OF THE ORGINAL CONTENT OF THIS FILE FROM THE FORK
## Description
We want you to implement a REST API endpoint that given a list of products, applies some
discounts to them and can be filtered.
You are free to choose whatever language and tools you are most comfortable with, but, we value you to use laravel since our main platform is also on laravel / php.
We will value your ability to apply the following rules on the corresponding layers following Domain Driven Design. 
Please add instructions on how to run it and publish it on your fork.

## Deliverable 

Fork the project, work on the solution and send us back a link to your forked GitHub project to examine your answer to this test.

## Conditions 


The prices are integers for example, 100.00â‚¬ would be 10000.
  
1. [x] You can store the products as you see fit (json file, in memory, rdbms of choice)
2. [x] Products in the "insurance" category have a 30% discount.
3. [x] The product with sku = 000003 has a 15% discount.
4. [x] Provide a single endpoint. GET /products.
5. [x] Can be filtered by category as a query string parameter.
6. [x] (optional) Can be filtered by price as a query string parameter, this filter applies before discounts are applied.
7. [x] Returns a list of Products with the given discounts applied when necessary Product model.
8. [x] price.currency is always EUR.
9. [x] When a product does not have a discount, price.final and price.original should be the same number and discount_percentage should be null.
10. [x] When a product has a discount, price.original is the original price, price.final is the amount with the discount applied and discount_percentage represents the applied discount with the % sign.

Example product with a discount of 30% applied:  
`    {
      "sku": "000001",
      "name": "Full coverage insurance",
      "category": "insurance",
      "price": {
          "original": 89000,
          "final": 62300,
          "discount_percentage": "30%",
          "currency": "EUR"
      }
    }`
  
  Example product without a discount:
  
      `{
        "sku": "000002",
        "name": "Compact Car X3",
        "category": "vehicle",
        "price": {
            "original": 89000,
            "final": 89000,
            "discount_percentage": null,
            "currency": "EUR"
        }
      }`
      
## Dataset.       
The following dataset is the only dataset you need to be able to serve on the API: 

`{
    "products": [
      {
        "sku": "000001",
        "name": "Full coverage insurance",
        "category": "insurance",
        "price": 89000
      },
      {
        "sku": "000002",
        "name": "Compact Car X3",
        "category": "vehicle",
        "price": 99000
      },
      {
        "sku": "000003",
        "name": "SUV Vehicle, high end",
        "category": "vehicle",
        "price": 150000
      },
      {
        "sku": "000004",
        "name": "Basic coverage",
        "category": "insurance",
        "price": 20000
      },

        "name": "Convertible X2, Electric",
        "category": "vehicle",
        "price": 250000
      }
    ]
  }`
